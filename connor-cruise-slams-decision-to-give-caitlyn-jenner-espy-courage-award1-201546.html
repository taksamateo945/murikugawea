Winning the AA award for courage?? Ashton is gonna come out and yell PUNK’D,” Connor tweeted, as reported by the <a href=#>New York Daily News</a>. “Don’t get me wrong. Do what you feel like doing and don’t let anyone stop you. But everyone is taking this way too seriously…There are so many more important things that should be talked about…And SO MANY MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE that actually deserve an award.”</p><p>Cruise's tirade then went on to address what he believed were the topics we should be focusing on, rather than <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>'s stepfather's transition from male to female. "Like the fact that we are overfishing and in 30 years there will be no more fish. Seems dumb but 85 percent of the worlds protein is fish," he wrote. "Or what about the fact that our planet is becoming less habitable on a daily basis. Yet the population is increasing at an alarming rate. Or the fact that we all can't even get a long on earth lol. We fight and kill each other. We have war and poverty. This needs to change," he added.</p><p>While some followers agreed with his stance that there could be more deserving winners of the award, like college basketball star <strong>Lauren Hill</strong> who lost her battle against brain cancer earlier this year, or DWTS star <strong>Noah Galloway</strong>, the army veteran who lost his arm and leg to a roadside bomb in Iraq, the overwhelming response was one of support for Jenner.</p><p>Having removed his incendiary tweets, Cruise later returned to the social media platform to try and explain the motive behind his online outpouring, and denied any lack of respect for the famous 65-year-old transgender woman.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Totally twisting what I said, if you read what I said I totally support being happy and am glad she is happy.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>— Connor Cruise (@TheConnorCruise) <a href=#>June 4, 2015</a></p><p>"Totally twisting what I said, if you read what I said I totally support being happy and am glad she is happy," Cruise wrote, defending himself. "We just need to as a nation and a world get back to business and making everything a better place," he continued, adding that his outburst was "way more about the problems the world needs to solve than about her guys."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqopp6kv26v0a6grJ1dqLmiudJmm56bmai2sLqMraZmn5mrsm6vwKKrpbGeYremus2eqWado6XGbq%2FOrqman5Virrit0Z1oZmpgZoJ1gg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
