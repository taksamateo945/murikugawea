Even today, and even if you didn’t live through it the first time, chances are you can recognize some 1950s and 1960s food that America has now forgotten.</p><p>While the likes of prune whip, salmon mousse, tuna noodle casserole, fish sticks, and yam ice cream deserve to be left on the culinary scrapheap of history, there are plenty of popular mid-century American dishes that merit a resurgence today. At first glance, beef Wellington, chicken Kiev, and chiffon pie may seem like dusty relics of the <a href=#>Mad Men</a> era, the kind of food your parents–if not your grandparents–made with help from an actual paper-and-ink cookbook. But if you give these dishes a second thought, or simply look at the mouth-watering things today’s cooks are doing with these classics, you’ll realize that they’re fully in keeping with modern standards of deliciousness:</p><h2 class=title>Tunnel Of Fudge</h2><img alt="Tunnel Of Fudge" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tunnel-of-fudge.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Given its name, there's no confusion about what it is. The only confusion is as to why we stopped making this.

Perhaps that simplicity and universality has something to do with the fact that no one can truly pinpoint its origins.

As hot as the meringue gets--and some set it directly on fire--the insulated ice cream will stay frozen.

Though it remains somewhat popular today, the increased availability and affordability of other meats have knocked meatloaf from its postwar perch.
