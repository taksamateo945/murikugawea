An uncomfortable meme may be just what you are looking for to end or indirectly tell your partner to change in a way that will not offend them if you are in a toxic relationship. Here are some examples of bad relationship memes.</p><p class=align-left><strong>1. Humble yourself</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/f21db3659b021c96.jpg><p class=align-left>If he or she sends this, the message is clear. You are not making it safe for her or him to confide in you. You may lose the best thing that will ever happen to you by not allowing them to talk to you or feeling that you know everything, so you cannot listen.</p><p class=align-left><strong>2. Healthy relationships</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/f41b299b948159f7.jpg><p class=align-left>A toxic relationship may be formed when each of you knows that they are wrong but cannot bring themselves to say they are sorry. Eventually, you tear each other down, something that a simple apology would have resolved.</p><p class=align-left><strong>3. Some attention</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c8e9536a4025bbe4.jpg><p class=align-left>You are not a good partner if you do not communicate or give the attention she or he needs. Being in such a relationship makes one frustrated.</p><p class=align-left><strong>4. Hello, I need it!</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/3564aa167b0ae98c.jpg><p class=align-left>This is a relevant meme that you can send your partner to tell them that they are giving you bad vibes. If they sent you this, then it is a red flag that soon, they will leave you.</p><p class=align-left><strong>5. Are we cute?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/164d99ae1616a918.jpg><p class=align-left>If this is your case and you can relate to this toxic relationship meme, then it is time to pack your bags and leave. Physical abuse is a projection of mental and emotional abuse already done, and clearly, the two of you are not a happy couple at all, so it is better to walk away.</p><p class=align-left><strong>6. Toxic ex</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/00d53e6d8c7cdf51.jpg><p class=align-left>Send this to him or her to warn them, and if they make any other moves, report them because they may harm you.</p><p class=align-left><strong>7. The one</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/f6990825f140707e.jpg><p class=align-left>Maybe you do not know that he or she is toxic.
