They were a well-known local band writing and performing their own music, gigging in pubs and clubs. When FBI’s lead singer left the band, and Morris left to concentrate on his career in hairdressing, Astley offered to be the lead vocalist. This was when he was noticed by the record producer Pete Waterman, who persuaded him to come to London to work at the Pete Waterman Limited (PWL) recording studio, with RCA Records publishing his records. Under the tutelage of the production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman, known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW), Astley was taught about the recording process and groomed for his future career, supposedly starting off as the recording studio “tea boy”. The reason for Astley to be hired as a “tape op” was to overcome his shyness. SAW also hired most of FBI, including Morris as a guitarist/songwriter.</p><p align=justify>In December 1989, Astley set off on his first world tour, touring 15 countries including the UK, US, Australia, and Japan.
