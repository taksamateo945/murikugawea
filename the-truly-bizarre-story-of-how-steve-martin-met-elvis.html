Martin said that it happened in 1971, while he was opening for Swedish actress, singer, and dancer Ann-Margret. Martin said that he knew Elvis would be coming to the show because he was friends with Ann-Margret, who appeared alongside him in the 1964 film “Viva Las Vegas.”</p><p dir=ltr>“My act was magic, I don’t think I played the banjo in that, but jokes and weird stuff,” Martin said, to set the stage. “First, I see a beautiful woman walking toward me and that was <a href=# rel=noopener>Priscilla</a>.

And he looked at me and said, ‘Son, you have an oblique sense of humor,’ which was kind of accurate.” Martin added, “He was absolutely dead-on, he really was.”</p><p>At this point in the story, there’s nothing particularly bizarre — although Elvis’ use of the word “oblique” was a little surprising — but it’s about to become the kind of weird Elvis story we’ve all come to expect from the man who used to try to move clouds with his mind&nbsp;and shot a TV that was showing a Robert Goulet performance (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Outsider</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybsDRrqOyZZKex6K%2B0Z5krKyfp8Zuu8Vmn6ivXajBpsLEZqSaqqSeu265xK1knqSmnsBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
