Today, we are taking a look back on some of the boys’ best outfits as seen on TV!</p><h3>Louis</h3><p>Honestly, we had so many favorite TV looks for Louis! From his suits, to his jackets, to his plain T-shirts, he looks handsome in everything. However, one of our favorites is definitely his look from the Teen Choice Awards.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/25-days-of-one-direction-a-collection-of-our-favorite-tv-looks-02.jpg alt="25 Days of One Direction: A collection of our favorite TV looks 2" width=1023 height=767 sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Niall</h3><p>We can’t get enough of Niall’s TV looks, especially when he is rocking out on his guitar! One of our personal favorites is his outfit when he performed on Good Morning America. It was a chilly day in New York City that morning, which is why he wore a few layers of jackets.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/25-days-of-one-direction-a-collection-of-our-favorite-tv-looks-03.jpg alt="25 Days of One Direction: A collection of our favorite TV looks 3" width=1023 height=767 sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Liam</h3><p>We love whenever Liam shows his arrow tattoo, and that is why one of our favorite Liam TV looks is from the Today Show. It is definitely one of his most iconic&nbsp;outfits.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/25-days-of-one-direction-a-collection-of-our-favorite-tv-looks-04.jpg alt="25 Days of One Direction: A collection of our favorite TV looks 4" width=1023 height=767 sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Harry</h3><p>We are OBSESSED with Harry’s TV outfits! Remember when Harry looked like an actual prince at the American Music Awards? One of our other favorites is Harry’s floral suit that he wore for his final performance on The X Factor before the break!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/25-days-of-one-direction-a-collection-of-our-favorite-tv-looks-05.jpg alt="25 Days of One Direction: A collection of our favorite TV looks 5" width=1023 height=767 sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>These pictures&nbsp;definitely brought back memories of us watching the boys perform live on TV.
