The singer revealed what she would say to Thiebaud if she ever ran into her during the show’s Plead the Fifth segment.</p><p>After a slight hesitation, Twain, 49, quipped: “I wish I’d never met you.”</p><p>Quick recap: Thiebaud had an affair with Twain’s husband and her chief musical producer <strong>Robert “Mutt” Lange</strong>, which ended their 17-year marriage in June 2010. (The exes share son Eja, now 13.) After that messy split, the “That Don’t Impress Me Much” singer found comfort in a familiar face — Thiebaud’s hubby<strong> Frederic Nicolas Thiebaud</strong>. After the couple swap, Twain wed Frederic in January 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Twain opened up about her broken marriage in <a href=#>Redbook magazine</a> back in May 2011, noting that she literally couldn’t speak after the betrayal.</p><p>“It was like I was kicked off my own bus while it was moving full speed ahead, and I landed in the dirt and everything I had was thrown out after me,” she said at the time. “And after tumbling and getting a mouthful of dirt, I had to try to stand up, then figure out where I was and start walking.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“When my marriage broke down, I got so physically constricted that I couldn’t get any volume out at all,” she added. “I couldn’t even call for my dog. I realize I couldn’t live without singing and had to do something about it. This is why I was like, ‘Just get it all out right now. Clean the pipes.'”</p><p>Twain — who just announced her final <a href=#>Rock This Country tour</a> — eventually recovered from the heartache, but admitted that it took eight months to do so. “Yes, I’m still me, and yes, I’m a mother, and yes, I’m a singer and a songwriter,” she said. “And I can love again, and I have friends, and yes, I’m alive.”</p><p>Watch the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqhmZ6erm7A1pqgp2WUnsC0sdJmnLFlkpuzbsPHqGScoJWWwaawjLCgraBdnbKzeceuqpuZnpl6uK3TnJ9mamBmgnJ%2Bkg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
