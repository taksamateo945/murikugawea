"You will likely have more energy, better skin, improved digestion and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease once you get used to eating raw food," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>says Shayna Komar</span></a><span>, a licensed and registered dietitian at Thomas F. Chapman Family Cancer Wellness at Piedmont. "When we eat too much overly-cooked, microwaved and processed foods, it leads to a list of health-related issues. Cooking may actually upset the natural structure of food, robbing it of its essential nutritional value."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/kacey-musgraves-4.jpg><p><span>Musgraves enjoys horseback riding, and was thrilled when she could finally buy her own horse, Mismo.

"If you look at the roots of country music, the songs that Willie Nelson has written or Hank Williams wrote, it's no darker than them," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "So I find the double standard interesting. It's not groundbreaking heathen ideas I'm writing about – but also not surprised because I know that country is the last bastion of the music industry that has a problem with things that other genres don't. So I went into it knowing I was pushing some buttons, but also thinking that was ridiculous at the same time.

"It is torture sometimes trying to eat healthy on the road, but I try my best," Musgraves says. "It's all about balance and still letting my tastebuds enjoy themselves. If there's a reason to celebrate or I'm somewhere that has some kind of food that I know I won't be able to resist, then I try to eat lighter all around that. Also, I try to eliminate carbs and most processed foods."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpJmTmsZuudSsnquZpprAbrXNZpmarJieu6h50q6grWWjna6zsdJmqZqqlWLDoq%2FAraCopl2ltbDAzqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
