First husband. I’m here to crash the wedding.”</p><p>The 40-year-old “scout” was able to climb over the fence, go down the slope to the estate and even go under the wedding tent while once again informing the guards who he was and why he came&nbsp; just a few hours before the ceremony.</p><p>No-one stopped the uninvited visitor until he entered the tent, which was being decorated at that time.</p><p>Entering the tent, Alexander categorically declared to the workers and decorators: “She is my first wife. She is only my wife!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Then the guards finally decided that all this was not good and detained the uninvited superhero, knocking him to the ground and accusing him of illegal entry into the private territory. He was later taken into custody at the Sheriff’s Department.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnFoqmsrF2dwrSuwKebZqaVlr%2BtxYycmKeblaGypXnToZxmq5mjtKa%2B0maunpyUnruoeZRram1xaWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
