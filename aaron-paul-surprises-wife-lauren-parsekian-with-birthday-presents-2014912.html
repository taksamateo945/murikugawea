The Breaking Bad star, 35, continued his trend of publicizing his overwhelming love for his wife <strong>Lauren Parsekian</strong> during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday, Dec. 8.&nbsp;</p><p>Promoting his new movie Exodus: Gods and Kings on the talk show, Paul was supported by Parsekian, 28, as well as her family and friends. While Mrs. Paul, who married the actor in May 2013, seemingly assumed she was to stay in the audience, she was soon brought on stage to join her husband and Kimmel, 47.</p><p>Looking surprised, the <a href=#>Kind Campaign</a> co-founder greeted the host and was quickly hooked up with a microphone.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wanna say right off that this is a surprise and Lauren did not know that this would happen,” Kimmel said. “Now, Aaron sent me an e-mail, asking me to surprise you with something for your birthday, since it is tonight and he had to do the show.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="aaron paul surprises lauren" width=467 height=329 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Parsekian celebrated her 28th birthday on Monday, Dec. 8, complete with social media tributes from Paul, <a href=#>who wrote</a>, “Happy birthday to my pretty little bird @laurenpaul8. You have changed my life and have single handedly made this world a kinder place (thank you for that) and we are all better off to simply know that you exist. I like you a lot and I hope you have a really fun birthday. Hugs and kisses all over you pretty little face.”</p><p>“I asked him, I said, ‘Send me a list of what kinds of things Lauren likes, and then we can maybe figure something out,'” Kimmel continued. “Let me tell you, your husband knows a lot about you. My wife was very mad at me after reading this list. It was really unbelievable.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Handing Parsekian a wrapped present, Kimmel explained, “One thing that Aaron told me is that you love Radiohead, the band Radiohead… Well, so, we contacted Radiohead, and they did not get back to us. But we did get you something special…”</p><p>As a close second to the alternative band, Kimmel kept with the “radio” theme and presented the birthday girl with a gift card to RadioShack.</p><p>See what Kimmel did with Pareskian’s preferences for <strong>Diana Ross</strong> and outer space in the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOmpirp55ivaLBy2aqrqqgp7a0sdJmrqKelWK5osHRnqVmqJGnwKa3yJqlZq%2BZqbVursirq6Gcka56sb7ErJynrKNif3F9k3Joaw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
