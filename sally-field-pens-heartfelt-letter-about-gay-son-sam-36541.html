"They are kind, loving and productive people. Each with their own list of talents and accomplishments."</p><p><a href=#><strong>Robin Roberts Confirms She's Gay: See Which Other Stars Came Out In 2013</strong></a></p><p>Sally continues, "Sam is my youngest son, by 18 years, and he's gay. To that, I say: So what?"</p><p>The Lincoln actress goes on to describe what her son, whose father is Sally's ex-husband Alan Greisman, was like when he was younger.</p><p>"Growing up, Sam wanted desperately to just be like his older brothersâ€” athletic, rambunctious and even a little bit macho," she remembers.</p><p>"He wanted to beat Eli at tennis, trounce Peter at computer football and learn everything about every basketball player on the court. But Sam was different. And his journey to allow himself to be what nature intended him to be was not an easy one."</p><p><a href=#><strong>What's In The Hollywood Water?! 6 Stars Who Look 20 Years Younger!</strong></a></p><p>The Oscar winner admits it was hard to stand by and watch her son struggle. "I wanted to jump in. But his older brothers held me back. They told me I couldn't travel that road for Sam. It was his to travel, not mine," writes Sally.</p><p>"I had to wait for him to own himself in his own time. I could make it easier only by standing visibly to the side, clearly loving him, always being there and always letting him know."</p><p>The Brothers & Sisters star says it took until the time he was 20 for her son to be able to stand up and say, "I am a gay man."</p><p>She considers it "one of the great privileges of my life to have been allowed to be a part of Sam's journey," and that's why she decided to join the HRC in their latest fight.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Patrick Stewart Hilariously Responds To Mistakenly Being Outed As Gay</strong></a></p><p>"Sam knows that if he ever marries, he'll have my full support. After all, I like to believe I raised him with the good sense to choose a great partner," the Pasadena-native writes.</p><p>"Whether you are LGBT yourself, a parent or grandparent of an LGBT child, or just a great person with strong convictions about what's fair and right, I hope I've convinced you to stand with HRC for equality," she concludes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e9Kao6WxXZu2prjDZqeepqNitaat0a2dnqSkYrmmwNOeqWaZkqTCtXnGmrBmq5%2BjerStzGZqb21kZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
