Upon his return, he is pardoned for his past transgressions, but even at that, he never settles down in Konoha but embarks on a journey for self-redemption. As a result, the next time that fans see Sasuke is in episode 21 of Boruto: Naruto’s Next Generations.</p><h2><strong>Sasuke Uchiha Left Konoha Village to Gain More Powers From Orochimaru</strong></h2><p>Sasuke Uchiha is not only one of the strongest characters in Naruto but one of the most complex. This complexity is tied to his background. He hails from the Uchiha clan in The Hidden Leaf Village and had a happy childhood. This happiness was later shattered the day that he returned home to find that all of Uchiha, including his parents, had been slaughtered and that the perpetrator was his beloved elder brother Itachi. Itachi goes on to mock him that the reason he spared him was that he is weak.</p><p>Such words make Sasuke Uchiha determined to become so powerful that he can exact revenge. In his quest to gain power, Sasuke Uchiha wholeheartedly throws himself into his ninja training. When this doesn’t satisfy him enough, he decides to seek powers in other ways. During the course of his ninja training, he encounters Orochimaru, a very powerful and skillful but malevolent character.</p><p>He nevertheless follows him to gain training that will make him very powerful. Sasuke Uchiha spends about two and half years training with Orochimaru and eventually absorbs him. He later encounters his elder brother and kills him, only to discover that his brother spared his life out of love and was forced to take the actions that he took.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sasuke.jpg><h2><strong>Sasuke Later Returns But Leaves Again on a Quest for Self Redemption</strong></h2><p>Having discovered that his quest for revenge and all the evil acts that he committed along the way, such as briefly joining Akatsuki terrorist organization and attempting to restart the great shinobi war, was based on a wrong idea, Sasuke Uchiha is conflicted. He engages in a brutal match with Naruto in episode 478 of Naruto Shippuden. At the end of the match, Naruto overcomes him but spares his life. He is later pardoned by the ruler of Konoha i.e. the 6th Hokage.</p><p>Despite the pardon, Sasuke decides to leave Hidden Leaf Village to redeem himself. He briefly returned to Konoha in events after episode 478 and got married to Sakura. It is later revealed that they had a daughter named Sarada together. Episode 478 marks the last episode of the Naruto Shippuden anime series, and the next series that comes is Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.</p><h2><strong>When Does Sasuke Come Back to the Leaf Village from Orochimaru?</strong></h2><p>Sasuke comes back to the Leaf Village from Orochimaru in episode 478 of Naruto Shippuden. After being pardoned for his sins, he gets married to Sakura, and they welcome a child together at some point. These events are not captured, but it is known that they took place, given that his wife and daughter form a prominent part of his story arc going forward.</p><h2><strong>Sasuke Uchiha Makes Sporadic Returns to Konoha During His Travels but Never Settles Down</strong></h2><p>Once he leaves Konoha, Sasuke Uchiha never really returns to settle back permanently in the village. He only makes sporadic appearances to visit his beloved daughter and wife. He has also made it his mission to protect Konoha and help out Naruto as much as possible. So, he also returns whenever there are risks that he needs to alert the village of. One such risk is associated with Kaguya, the ten-tailed beast.</p><p>On another occasion, he warns Naruto about Momoshiki and Kinshiki, the two sons of Kaguya who are seeking the tailed beast power for themselves. When the two brothers abduct Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha joins Naruto’s son, Boruto, and the leaders of the ninja villages to rescue him. Following the rescue, he, Boruto, and Naruto join hands to defeat the two brothers.</p><h2><strong>His Frequent Travels Impact His Family, but They Still Love Him</strong></h2><p>Sasuke Uchiha’s frequent travels mean he cannot always be around for his family. He makes sporadic returns to see them, but his daughter largely grows up without him. This makes her resentful, and she leaves the village of Konoha to confront him at Ridge Tower, a surrounding place. Sarada had heard that Naruto was going to meet her dad and so tagged behind.</p><p>Upon getting to Ridge Tower, she confronts her dad and asks why he is never around. She asks him several questions, including about the era in which he was a villain. She doesn’t get satisfactory answers and storms out. All of this takes place in episode 21 of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. As the season progresses, Sarada softens her stance toward her dad, and they build a good relationship.</p><p>For instance, in episode 127 of Boruto, she writes him a heartwarming letter. He is on one of his rare trips home, and she welcomes him. She thanks him for his hard work and asks him if he is eating properly, as she knows he is often busy. She remarks on the fact that he is rarely home and tells him that her mother wants them all to eat together once in a while.</p><p>She then relays Boruto’s request to him to borrow make-out tactics from Kakashi Sensei and ends the letter with a declaration of her love. It is a very <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">touching</a> letter, and Sasuke Uchiha carries it with him whenever he travels. He often whips out the letter and reads it, bringing a rare but beautiful smile to his face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sasuke-1.jpg><h2><strong>When Does Sasuke Come Back in Boruto?</strong></h2><p>Sasuke comes back in episode 52 of Boruto. The episode is aptly titled <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Sasuke’s Shadow</a>. It is the occasion of Boruto’s birthday, and the young lad is angry that his busy father can’t be at the celebrations. He hears a knock on the door and goes to open it, thinking that it is his father. It, however, turns out to be Sasuke.</p><p>Boruto throws a punch at Sasuke, but he expertly deflects it and leaves. Boruto is impressed by this and seeks to find out more about the man. Sasuke will later become his ninja training teacher. Episode 52 is the first time that Sasuke Uchiha returns to Konoha in Boruto. However, Sasuke’s first appearance in Boruto is actually in episode 21, when his daughter confronts him. That confrontation, however, took place at Ridge Tower and not Konoha.</p><h2><strong>What Episode Does Sasuke Come Back?</strong></h2><p>Sasuke comes back in Boruto episode 52. However, when it comes to Naruto Shippuden, Sasuke comes back in episode 478. He comes back to embark on a fierce fight with Naruto, and Naruto eventually defeats him. He is, however, pardoned for his sins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2Bstaa6jJ2mnqtdqK60wcqeZJynnZp6o63CpGSappRitq951qGYrWWVpba0u8OeZJqmlGLApq3SqKVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
