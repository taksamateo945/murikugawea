With the building of airports across the country and the launching of new airlines every now and then, air transportation has become one of the most effective and easiest ways of transportation so far. Dubbed The Wings of Nigeria, Arik Air has been able to emerge as one the most popular and successful airlines not only in Nigeria but also in Africa at large. Introduced in the year 2006 with offices in Lagos and Abuja, the airline now operates in many states in Nigeria. So far, it is one of the cheapest and most reliable airlines that has its operations within Nigeria.</p><h2><strong>Brief History Of Arik Airline</strong></h2><p>Arik Airline was founded in the year 2002 by Joseph Arumemi-Ikhide. It commenced its operations on the 30th of October 2006 with two hubs in Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. The airline has its head office located at the Arik Air Aviation Center in Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos. The airline began its international flight operations on the 4th of April 2008 when it was granted permission to fly to the United States of America. They were further granted access to London on the 15th of December 2008. This gave them access to other International countries like Dubai, Johannesburg, and New York JFK.</p><p>Due to certain financial crises, the airline was taken over by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). To enable a complete change of the administrative procedures that led to financial instability, the airline was merged with Aero Contractors and is targeted to have a new brand name called Nigeria Eagle (NG Eagle). Irrespective of these, the airline still serves its customers at its best.</p><h2><strong>Steps To Booking Flights With Arik Air</strong></h2><p>Arik Airline has one of the easiest flight booking procedures.

These include:</p><ul><li>Return trips</li><li>One-way trips</li><li>Multiple destinations</li></ul><p>When booking Arik Air flights, you have to be specific, indicating if it is a return trip, one-way trip, or multiple destinations trip.</p><h3><strong>Arik Air Booking Requirements</strong></h3><p>Before you set out to book a flight, you need to get some things ready. You will be required to avail certain information and documents at the time of booking. Essentially, you will need an identification document most importantly a valid passport or national identification/travel document. The information being sought includes:</p><ul><li>Full names as can be seen in the passport or identification document</li><li>Your nationality</li><li>Date of birth</li><li>The passport or identification/travel number</li><li>The types of document</li><li>Issuing date and expiry date</li></ul><p>It is noteworthy that the above information will be collected automatically when you submit your passport.</p><h4><strong>Provide Basic Information</strong></h4><p>The basic information you need to provide depends on the nature of your trip. Those booking for one-way trips will be required to provide the date of flight, your travel destination (departure and arrival airports), and the number of travelers (for example family members) for whom you wish to secure Arik Air tickets for.</p><p>Those who wish to book return tickets must provide in addition, their return flight dates. Furthermore, you will have to choose whether you want to travel using the economy class or business class as the classes differ in ticket prices. If you intend to visit more than one destination, then you will have to provide information for each destination. They will be numbered from one (for example destination 1, destination 2, etc.)</p><p>You can book flights at the Arik Air offices nearest to you but the most convenient, cost-effective, and easy way to make your flight bookings is to do it online on the official website of Arik Air. The online application is simple and straightforward. However, you must ensure that the information you provide is accurate and correct as any wrong entry can cause unnecessary flight delays.</p><p>Other information you will need to provide during the booking process is the ideal time of the day and favorable flight duration you wish to travel. Arik Air will give you a list of departure times for your travel date as well as a list of flights by the number of stopovers and length. This will help you choose the best time of the day that fits your schedule and the shortest flight if you so desire.</p><h4><strong>Provide Your Payment Information</strong></h4><p>After completing the paperwork for your booking and confirming the details as accurate, and correct, it is time to seal the deal by making payment. Arik Air accepts both cash and credit card payments. Ensure you provide the correct information if you are using your credit card to avoid losses and unnecessary delays. Confirmation of payment will release the ticket and your booking process will be complete.</p><h2><strong>Arik Air Nigeria Check-In</strong></h2><p>With the booking ticket in your hand, your only job will be to wait for the due traveling date to check-in and board. The Arik Air check-in counters usually open 2.5 hours before the departure time for the local (domestic) flights and 4 hours before the departure time for international flights. You are supposed to check in within these times. If you arrive later than these times, you run a risk of missing your flight.</p><p>At the check-in desk, you will be required to produce the booking ticket or tickets, your passport, and anything else that you might have been asked to provide during booking time to carry with you when checking in. An example is your company identification card. Passengers of Arik Air are required to check-in before the closure of the check-in desks, which are 45 minutes for domestic flights and 2 hours for international flights prior to the planned departure time. This policy is strictly adhered to by Arik Air.</p><p>It is important to note that you can only check-in online 24 hours prior to your flight time. After checking in, you can print a boarding pass or request for it to be sent to your email so that you can present it at the airport for a speedier check-in process.</p><h2><strong>The Affordability Of Arik Airline Compared To Other Airlines</strong></h2><p>In a bid to have a clear determined comparison between the Arik Airline flight prices with that of other Nigerian airline operators like Air Peace and Green Africa, the charges for local flights within Nigeria will be used focusing more on departure.</p><p>Though the prices vary with time, the least amount for Arik Air on a departure flight from Lagos to Abuja is N25,357 on economy class. Furthermore, considering the Air Peace on the same category of departure flight from Lagos to Abuja goes with a list price of N29,402. Green Africa, on the other hand, also goes through changes as the flight schedule time changes. The minimum price for a departure flight from Lagos to Abuja is N24,000 on economy class.</p><p>Looking at the round trip price of the three focus airlines, Arik Air places a charge of N26,025 as the least amount for a trip from Abuja to Lagos making use of the economy class. Air Peace goes ahead to maintain their charge as N29,402 on a round trip or multiple city flights from Abuja to Lagos on the economy class while Green Africa maintains their price of N24,000 on the round trip flight schedule from Abuja to Lagos making use of the economy class.</p><h2><strong>Is Arik Air Still Active In Nigeria?</strong></h2><p>Despite all the ups and downs experienced by the airline in the past, they still hold ground in the Nigerian aviation industry as one of the leading airlines in Nigeria and other parts of Africa.
