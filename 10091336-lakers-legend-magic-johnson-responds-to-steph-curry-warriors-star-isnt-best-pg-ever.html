Both players changed the way the position is played forever, albeit in very different ways.</p><p>Johnson is arguably the best passer in NBA history. He averaged more than 10 assists per game in nine consecutive seasons and is the league's <a href=# rel=noopener>all-time leader</a> with 11.2 assists per game.</p><p>Curry is the arguably the best three-point shooter ever.
