"I think it took me a long while to get there because the past year was so interesting because I've never been body-shamed before. I dealt with a whole other set of issues that was really interesting."</p><p>"I did gain weight, but I don’t care," the "Love You Like a Love Song" singer, 23, said, but she also admitted that the online criticism got to her "a little bit" but "sometimes you can't help" reading the comments.</p><p>"You know what's interesting? I posted <a href=#>this photo on Instagram</a> and I was like, 'There’s more to love and I’m happy with myself.' The reason why I did that was because I didn't want them to win," Gomez said. "Because then the next day, it wasn't about how I&nbsp;gained weight, it was about how I embraced it. And that’s just kind of&nbsp;my approach."</p><p><a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>'s ex also talked about her recent single "Good for You," explaining that while on the surface the song is about a woman who wants to look good for her man, the lyrics have a deeper meaning about female liberation.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Swift’s Squad</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"There's nothing wrong with a woman being comfortable, confident," she said. "I love feeling like I'm in love and I want to look good for someone, but at the same time there's no guy in my video. I'm saying I am a diamond. I like the way that women feel when they're in that state."</p><p>Gomez's second studio album, Revival, drops Oct. 9.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKqepJWjrm6zzqacs2Wklrmsv4yfmK1lo52urrXNoGSiZZSesW6zwKKlZq%2BVnrSpwIybrK1lmWKxsLrTZpqaqpVif3F9lGpocg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
