Our hearts are so full,” the actress captioned her Instagram reveal at the time. “Thank you to all of our friends and family and all of you who have supported Mike and I, and our growing family. We are so blessed, and a huge thank you to&nbsp;@avawomen&nbsp;for helping us grow our family.&nbsp;#rainbowbaby&nbsp;#blessed.”</p><p>In September 2019, Kramer told Us exclusively that <a href=#>Jace’s birth bettered her relationship</a> with the former professional football player. The pair briefly split following&nbsp;Jolie’s arrival when <a href=#>the athlete cheated on the Michigan native with multiple women</a>. After&nbsp;he completed 60 days in treatment <a href=#>for sex addiction</a>, Caussin and Kramer renewed their vows in December 2017.</p><p>“People always say [that babies are] not going to help your relationship, but it helped ours,” the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars </a>alum told Us at the time. “Having Jace literally saved our marriage.”</p><p>The Virginia native chimed in, “I think it’s a little different because we weren’t like, ‘We’re having a hard time. Let’s try to have a kid and make it all better.’ It was, ‘We’re having a hard time [and] you found out you’re pregnant.’ It wasn’t like we had a discussion about how it could solve [our relationship].”</p><p>In April 2021, Us confirmed that <a href=#>Kramer had filed for divorce</a>. She addressed the split via Instagram, writing, “‘It’s time.’ As I try to make sense of a reality I never wanted to believe could be possible again, those words have now become a reality. I’ve fought y’all. I’ve loved hard. I’ve forgiven. I’ve put the work in. I’ve given everything I have, and now I have nothing else to give.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to check out the exes’ adorable moments with their little ones, from first steps and family Halloween costumes to matching outfits and new pets.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Usmagazine.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toopGjrm630ZqknqpdorassYycmK6ro567tHnSsJyerJWowW65zqacp6yjYsSqwMdmoqKco2KuqbHAnWSonl2ova2102g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
