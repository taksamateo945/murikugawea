The Magnolia Table With Joanna Gaines star explained that, amid the hum of her laundry room, she finds some peace in a place she said “lets me be my truest self.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/joanna-gaines-magnolia-1.jpg><h2>Joanna Gaines explained why her laundry room ‘lets me be my truest self’</h2><p>On Aug. 28, Gaines took to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to share a glimpse at a favorite room in her house. “I brought a table and chair into our laundry room a few years ago when I realized the place where I wash and fold may be one of my favorite spaces in our home,” she wrote in the caption.</p><p>“It seems like no matter what’s gone on out there, how loud the world gets, I can always come back to the familiar quiet in here: the swoosh of the wash, the rumble of the dryer, the piles undone at rest on the floor,” Gaines continued. “There is something about the ordinary, the profound absence of performance in this space that lets me be my truest self.”</p><p>She added, “So this is where I journal, where I’ll come to solve a problem, <a href=#>say a prayer</a>, or simply sort my thoughts. And it was here that I wrote down a lot of my story — free from the noise and any expectations. Feeling grateful today for this space and what it helped shape.

The humdrum of life that can be so peaceful.”</p><p>One of her fans marveled, “Who would’ve thought a laundry room can give you inspiration, love it!!!”</p><p>Another person shared, “Every creative woman needs a respite, don’t we? A room that feels like a warm quiet hug where we can listen to and hear our own inner voice.”</p><p>Others said they loved seeing the peaceful room. Comments included, “So tranquil! Wish I had a space like this to escape to!” and “That’s the most peaceful, beautiful laundry room I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Another fan wrote, “Same!
