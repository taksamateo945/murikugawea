Hopkins and Fuller were far from the only players to help deliver victories to fantasy managers too.</p><p>Here, we'll dig into some of the top fantasy stars of Week 12, the latest NFL standings and the full results from Sunday's action.</p><p><strong>NFL Week 12 Scores and Fantasy Stars</strong></p><p>Houston Texans 20, Indianapolis Colts 17 (Thursday)</p><p>WR DeAndre Hopkins: six receptions, 94 receiving yards, two TDs</p><p>WR Will Fuller V: seven receptions, 140 receiving yards</p><p>Buffalo Bills 20, Denver Broncos 3</p><p>RB Devin Singletary: 106 rushing yards, one reception, eight receiving yards</p><p>WR Cole Beasley: six receptions, 76 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>New York Jets 34, Oakland Raiders 3</p><p>QB Sam Darnold: 315 passing yards, two passing TDs, 16 rushing yards, one rushing TD</p><p>WR Robby Anderson: four receptions, 86 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Chicago Bears 19, New York Giants 14</p><p>WR Allen Robinson: six receptions, 131 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>RB Tarik Cohen: 25 rushing yards, seven receptions, 29 receiving yards</p><p>Cleveland Browns 41, Miami Dolphins 24</p><p>WR Jarvis Landry: 10 receptions, 148 receiving yards two TDs</p><p>RB Nick Chubb: 106 rushing yards, three receptions, 58 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>Pittsburgh Steelers 16, Cincinnati Bengals 10</p><p>WR James Washington: three receptions, 98 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>WR Tyler Boyd: five receptions, 101 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>Seattle Seahawks 17, Philadelphia Eagles 9</p><p>RB Rashaad Penny: 129 rushing yards, one TD</p><p>TE Zach Ertz: 12 receptions, 91 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>Washington Redskins 19, Detroit Lions 16</p><p>WR Terry McLaurin: five receptions, 72 receiving yards</p><p>RB Bo Scarbrough: 98 rushing yards</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers 35, Atlanta Falcons 22</p><p>WR Chris Godwin: seven receptions, 184 receiving yards, two TDs</p><p>WR Calvin Ridley: six receptions, 85 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>New Orleans Saints 34, Carolina Panthers 31</p><p>RB Christian McCaffrey: 64 rushing yards, nine receptions, 69 receiving yards, two TDs</p><p>WR Michael Thomas: 10 receptions, 101 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tennessee Titans 42, Jacksonville Jaguars 20</p><p>RB Derrick Henry: 159 rushing yards, one reception, 16 receiving yards, two TDs</p><p>RB Leonard Fournette: 97 rushing yards, nine receptions, 62 receiving yards, two TDs</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>New England Patriots 13, Dallas Cowboys 9</p><p>RB Ezekiel Elliott: 86 rushing yards, four receptions, 40 receiving yards</p><p>WR Julian Edelman: eight receptions, 93 receiving yards</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>San Francisco 49ers 37, Green Bay Packers 8</p><p>TE George Kittle: six receptions, 129 receiving yards, one TD</p><p>WR Davante Adams: seven receptions, 43 receiving yards, one TD</p><p><strong>DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller, WRs, Houston Texans</strong></p><p>As previously mentioned, Fuller and Hopkins were huge for the Texans on Thursday night. Fuller made his return after missing three games with a hamstring injury, and he wasted no time getting in on the action. He's one of the top deep threats in the NFL, as evidenced by his 140 yards on seven receptions.</p>NFL Research <span class=acct>@NFLResearch</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>.@deshaunwatson to @Will_Fuller7 is clearly an explosive connection. In his career, Watson has averaged an extra 62.5 passing yards and 1.1 passing touchdowns per game when Fuller plays than when he does not. @HoustonTexans | #WeAreTexans</p><p>Hopkins, meanwhile, continued to do Hopkins things. Despite getting a lot of attention from the Colts secondary, he was regularly there when quarterback Deshaun Watson needed to make a play.</p><p>Though he only caught six passes, Hopkins turned those into 94 yards and two touchdowns. He remains a weekly must-start, though next week's matchup with the New England Patriots is a tough one.</p><p><strong>Sam Darnold, QB, New York Jets</strong></p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/962/740/859cc9bc569cffd7baf2418d195145c9_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/962/740/859cc9bc569cffd7baf2418d195145c9_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Seth Wenig/Associated Press</span><p>In one of the more surprising results of Sunday, the New York Jets obliterated the Oakland Raiders 34-3. For Oakland, a lot of blame has to fall on an offense that couldn't get in a rhythm all game long. However, Jets quarterback Sam Darnold deserves a ton of credit for delivering the win to New York.</p><p>Darnold finished the game with 315 passing yards, 16 rushing yards and three total touchdowns.</p><p>This marks the third consecutive game in which Darnold has shined, as The Athletic's Connor Hughes pointed out:</p>Connor Hughes <span class=acct>@Connor_J_Hughes</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>#Jets QB Sam Darnold in his last three games: 58 of 89 (65%) for 838 yards with 7 TDs, 2 rushing touchdowns, 1 INT &amp;amp; a QB rating of 117.6. Oh, and the Jets are 3-0 in those games (Giants, Redskins, Raiders)</p><p>Darnold's improved play is tremendous for the Jets, obviously, but it's also great for fantasy managers who took a chance on him. Expect Darnold to remain a solid fantasy option over the next two weeks, as he has matchups against the Cincinnati Bengals and Miami Dolphins.</p><p><strong>Jarvis Landry, WR, Cleveland Browns</strong></p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/962/742/ba3d17fa9256b106ec56b35f0497c53c_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/962/742/ba3d17fa9256b106ec56b35f0497c53c_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>David Richard/Associated Press</span><p>Cleveland's acquisition of wideout Odell Beckham Jr. was one of the most noteworthy moves of the NFL offseason. However, it's been holdover Jarvis Landry who has emerged as Baker Mayfield's favorite target.</p><p>Of course, Beckham, who is a friend and former LSU teammate, is one of Landry's biggest supportersâ€”and the two play extremely well together.</p><p>"A game like this is going to mean a lot when he goes for 156 yards and two touchdowns and nine receptions," Beckham <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> before the game, per Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com.</p><p>Beckham was nearly spot-on, as Landry finished with 10 receptions, 148 yards and two touchdowns against his former team, the Miami Dolphins. Landry has found the end zone in four consecutive games and remains a fantasy must-start moving forward.</p><p><strong>Derrick Henry, RB, Tennessee Titans</strong></p><p>The Tennessee Titans managed to keep pace in the AFC South by picking up a big win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. They're now tied with Indianapolis for second place in the division and have all but erased Jacksonville from the divisional chase.</p><p>Sunday's win largely came courtesy of running back Derrick Henry. The fourth-year back ran around over and through the Jaguars defense all game long, finishing with 159 rushing yards, two touchdowns and a ridiculous 8.4 yards-per-carry average.</p><p>His day was highlighted by an incredible 74-yard scamper:</p>Bleacher Report <span class=acct>@BleacherReport</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>DERRICK. HENRY. 74-YARD HOUSE CALL ðŸ¤¯ He does it again vs. the Jags. (via @NFL) https://t.co/PETz75gLti</p><p>To say that Jacksonville didn't have an answer for Henry would be an understatement. So would saying that Henry is a must-start against the Colts next week. Henry had 94 total yards and a touchdown the last time Indianapolis and Tennessee faced off.</p>Ben Volin <span class=acct>@BenVolin</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Up-to-the-minute AFC playoff standings: The Pittsburgh Steelers, left for dead in September, leapfrog Indy and Oakland for the No. 6 seed https://t.co/hEGT8fGmA0</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>Ben Volin <span class=acct>@BenVolin</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>And here are the NFC playoff standings: Packers hold the tiebreaker over the Vikings, the NFC East stinks, and if the Rams lose tomorrow the field is basically set https://t.co/J6sawvcwDb</p><p><strong>Week 12 NFL Standings</strong></p><p>New England Patriots 10-1</p><p>Buffalo Bills 8-3</p><p>New York Jets 4-7</p><p>Miami Dolphins 2-9</p><p>Baltimore Ravens 8-2</p><p>Pittsburgh Steelers 6-5</p><p>Cleveland Browns 5-6</p><p>Cincinnati Bengals 0-11</p><p>Houston Texans 7-4</p><p>Indianapolis Colts 6-5</p><p>Tennessee Titans 6-5</p><p>Jacksonville Jaguars 4-7</p><p>Kansas City Chiefs 7-4</p><p>Oakland Raiders 6-5</p><p>Los Angeles Chargers 4-7</p><p>Denver Broncos 3-8</p><p>Dallas Cowboys 6-5</p><p>Philadelphia Eagles 5-6</p><p>New York Giants 2-9</p><p>Washington Redskins 2-9</p><p>Green Bay Packers 8-3</p><p>Minnesota Vikings 8-3</p><p>Chicago Bears 5-6</p><p>Detroit Lions 3-7-1</p><p>New Orleans Saints 9-2</p><p>Carolina Panthers 5-6</p><p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4-7</p><p>Atlanta Falcons 3-8</p><p>San Francisco 49ers 10-1</p><p>Seattle Seahawks 9-2</p><p>Los Angeles Rams 6-4</p><p>Arizona Cardinals 3-7-1</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXFuZGWBdXnNn6Nmq5Okv6a%2FjLCcnqNdZn9urcWcZKeek2K%2Fpr%2FUpausZaChrrq7xZ9krKyRo7GqusasZJqmlGLBsLyMn5inrJGoxm6%2F05qprA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
