His performance then cratered after 2012, reaching a nadir in 2014.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/187/972/2d01dd35df69739e237fc68dc2a69276_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/187/972/2d01dd35df69739e237fc68dc2a69276_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Julio Cortez/Associated Press</span><p>It wasn't exactly shocking when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> of Vick's impending departure from New York emerged in February.</p><p>He only started three games for the Jets and acknowledged after a poor Week 5 showing against the San Diego Chargers that he was ill-prepared to take over for Smith, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darryl Slater</a> of NJ Advance Media:</p><p class=ui-droppable>I learned a lesson last week: Always stay ready, always be prepared. That left a bitter taste in my mouth, that I wasn’t able to go out and put points on the board or even help this team in any fashion. This week has been a different work week for me. I think throughout the rest of the year, it’s going to be totally different for me, as far as my preparation.</p><p>Considering the Jets signed Vick to back up Smith and be a spot starter, the former No. 1 overall pick had to feel somewhat of a letdown taking practice reps behind an unproven youngster. He didn't mentally ready himself for ever needing to replace Smith at a moment's notice.</p><p>Since Vick's performance never picked up over the course of the 2014 campaign, it sealed his fate with the Jets, whose new regime chose Bryce Petty in the fourth round of this year's draft and signed Ryan Fitzpatrick in free agency.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nathan Jahnke</a> of Pro Football Focus believes the current version of Vick doesn't offer much to the Steelers: &nbsp;</p><p class=ui-droppable>If the Steelers had the 2011 version of Michael Vick, they would be feeling much better about their offensive situation in the event Roethlisberger were have to come off the field. But Vick has had a negative pass grade every year since then.</p><p class=ui-droppable>Luckily, the Steelers have one of the better offensive lines in football (although Maurkice Pouncey is expected to miss extended time with an injury), and had the seventh-best pass protection in the league last season. But that won’t be enough to save Vick and the Steelers’ offense if Roethlisberger were to get injured.</p><p>Expectations will continue to be tempered for Vick in 2015. Fans have to have given up hope of witnessing the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Vick Experience</a>" again in light of what's happened in recent years, and another Philly-like career renaissance seems out of the question.</p><p>Perhaps Vick will be able to enjoy a more successful run as a backup in Pittsburgh&nbsp;than he did on a Jets team with a lame duck coach in <a href=#>Rex Ryan</a> that wasn't exactly a paragon of stability.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaWxvYGx%2BcXnMopqhmZWhere1wqRkraddqMGmscueqaxlnJbBpr%2FTZpqopqSnrqTAjJ2crZmZocBur86mpJ6mpKh6orrDZqmemZOptrC6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
