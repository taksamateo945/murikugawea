In their last meeting, Argentina eliminated the Dutch in the 2014 semifinals on penalties.</p><p>Over the next three days, the Dutch and Argentinians will be joined by six other teams in the final eight. England and France can book their places in the quarterfinals on Sunday.</p><p><b>Saturday's Results</b></p><p><b>Argentina 2, Australia 1</b></p><p>Argentina methodically put away Australia to earn its fourth quarterfinal berth in the last five World Cups.</p><p>Lionel Messi used a moment of magic in the 35th minute to put the Albiceleste in front. Messi continued his run from the left wing after a failed free kick and slotted home through a pair of defenders and into the back of the net.</p>FOX Soccer <span class=acct>@FOXSoccer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>MESSI MAGIC ‚ú®üá¶üá∑&lt;br>&lt;br>That's the first knockout stage goal in Messi's FIFA World Cup career &lt;a href="https://t.co/wyzfdVfby3">pic.twitter.com/wyzfdVfby3&lt;/a></p><p>Messi's 35th-minute tally was his first-ever goal in the World Cup knockout stages. That statistic was hard to believe since he has been an integral part of Argentina's national team for over a decade.</p><p>Juli√°n √Ålvarez padded the lead in the 57th minute after some disastrous decision-making by Matt Ryan in front of the Soccerros goal. Ryan kept the ball at his feet too long and allowed the pressure by Rodrigo De Paul and √Ålvarez to force him into a mistake.</p>FOX Soccer <span class=acct>@FOXSoccer</span><p lang=es dir=ltr>TWO FOR ARGENTINA üá¶üá∑&lt;br>&lt;br>Juli√°n √Ålvarez adds on to the lead üî• &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ugvb3OMZwX">pic.twitter.com/Ugvb3OMZwX&lt;/a></p><p>√Ålvarez's goal ended up meaning more to Argentina once the Aussies found the back of the net in the 77th minute. Craig Goodwin lashed a shot from outside the box and took a deflection on its way past Emiliano Martinez.</p>FOX Soccer <span class=acct>@FOXSoccer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don't count the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Socceroos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Socceroos&lt;/a> out yet üëÄüá¶üá∫ &lt;a href="https://t.co/0pkuMfsiQ3">pic.twitter.com/0pkuMfsiQ3&lt;/a></p><p>The tally eventually went down as an Enzo Fernandez on goal, but that was all the Aussies could muster, despite some late pressure, against an Argentinian defense that came into Saturday with two straight clean sheets.</p><p>Messi and Co. will try to make it back to the semifinals with a win on Friday that could set up an all-South American clash with Brazil in the final four. Brazil plays South Korea and then the Japan-Croatia winner if it wins in the Round of 16.</p><p><b>Netherlands 3, United States 1</b></p><p>The Netherlands ended the United States' run in Qatar with a few attacking moves that capitalized on mistakes by the American back line.</p><p>Memphis Depay put the Dutch in front in the 10th minute, when he ran into a pocket of space at the top of the box and easily beat Matt Turner.</p>FOX Soccer <span class=acct>@FOXSoccer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Netherlands takes the lead! üá≥üá±&lt;br>&lt;br>Memphis Depay gets things started for Oranje &lt;a href="https://t.co/qu4cljENCn">pic.twitter.com/qu4cljENCn&lt;/a></p><p>The Oranje defended for most of the first half after Memphis' opening strike. They doubled their advantage right before halftime, as Daley Blind beat Sergi√±o Dest to a ball that came off a Netherlands throw-in.</p>FOX Soccer <span class=acct>@FOXSoccer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Netherlands make it two!&lt;br>&lt;br>In the final seconds of the first half, Daley Blind makes it 2-0 üá≥üá± &lt;a href="https://t.co/pZThbgnKUK">pic.twitter.com/pZThbgnKUK&lt;/a></p><p>The Americans controlled the possession battle in the first half, but they only had two significant chances in the first 45 minutes. Christian Pulisic missed a golden opportunity in the opening minutes and Timothy Weah had a shot from distance turned away before the second Dutch goal.</p>FOX Soccer <span class=acct>@FOXSoccer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Weah with a STRIKE but Noppert comes up with the save!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USMNT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@USMNT&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/B3eiSE7fsy">pic.twitter.com/B3eiSE7fsy&lt;/a></p><p>The Americans were more progressive in the final third in the second half thanks to the additions of Gio Reyna, Brenden Aaronson and Haji Wright.</p><p>Wright put the Americans on the scoreboard in the 76th minute with a goal off his back heel. The tally came minutes after Wright blew a potential open goal with a poor first touch.</p>FOX Soccer <span class=acct>@FOXSoccer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>THERE IT IS!&lt;br>&lt;br>THE &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USMNT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@USMNT&lt;/a> TAKES ONE BACK üî•üá∫üá∏ &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZaxPsw2pNU">pic.twitter.com/ZaxPsw2pNU&lt;/a></p><p>The USMNT's hope did not last long, as Denzel Dumfires scored in the 81st minute on another defensive breakdown by the Americans. Dumfries was one of the best Dutch players on the field inside the Khalifa International Stadium.</p>FOX Soccer <span class=acct>@FOXSoccer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Netherlands scores a third!&lt;br>&lt;br>Netherlands now leads the USMNT 3-1 late in the second half &lt;a href="https://t.co/HsmcVco9V2">pic.twitter.com/HsmcVco9V2&lt;/a></p><p>The Dutch advanced to at least the semifinals in their last two World Cups in 2010 and 2014.
