I used a tiny plate and threw together some romaine lettuce, green peppers, and cucumbers. I topped the salad with salt and pepper, sat down at a booth, and added up the calories on the&nbsp;app on my phone. It brought my total intake of the day of just over 500, which scared me to death. I’d been under 500 every other day that week, and all my progress was going to be ruined because of a salad.

You’ll make excuses for days, week, even months to justify&nbsp;why your eating habits are the way they are. You’ll hide behaviors from people without even noticing it. You’ll tell yourself that it’s just temporary, and you’ll go back to normal soon. You’ll convince yourself that other people do worse things, so you can’t be that bad off. You’ll realize that no one else seems too concerned about you, so there probably isn’t anything to worry about. But if you find yourself having to repeat these mantras on a daily basis, you need to take a closer look at your situation.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Symptoms of eating disorders vary depending on which one someone suffers from, but the following factors, especially when combined, may indicate a deeper problem:</span></p><ul class=ul1><li class=li1><span class=s1>constant dieting</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>overeating</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>fear of food</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>feeling out of control when it comes to food</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>weighing yourself frequently</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>avoiding situations in which food is involved</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>adapting rituals when eating – cutting food into tiny pieces, taking frequent sips of water, etc.</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>lying to others about how much you eat or when you eat</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>making excuses not to eat</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>making a list of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ foods</span></li><li class=li1>only eating when alone</li><li class=li1><span class=s1>obsessively counting calories</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>fluctuating weight</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>mood changes</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>loss of period in females</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>dizziness and fatigue</span></li><li class=li1><span class=s1>finding your mind preoccupied with food and calories&nbsp;</span></li><li class=li1>excessive exercising</li></ul><p class=p1><span class=s1>If you feel you suffer from one or more of the things listed above, and if you think that it could become a serious problem in the future, do not hesitate to reach out and get help.
