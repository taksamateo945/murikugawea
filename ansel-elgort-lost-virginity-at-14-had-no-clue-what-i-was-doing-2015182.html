Fault in Our Stars hunk<strong> Ansel Elgort</strong> revealed in <a href=#>Elle</a>'s March 2015 issue that he lost his virginity at a young age, and the circumstances at the time were anything but romantic.</p><p>"I was 14," Elgort, now 20, told the mag. "I had no clue what I was doing, and neither did the girl… I didn’t even make the lighting good. That’d be one thing I’d do differently. It was, like, fluorescent, bright bedroom light, like, over the covers."</p><p>While the first time was a fumble, Elgort said he and the girl "definitely [did] not" wait to give it another go. "The only thing that made me feel better was doing it again," the Divergent actor explained, realizing that he may have come off too forward.</p><p>"Don’t make me sound like a playboy, because I’m not," he told the mag. "Cause if someone I’m monogamous with reads this, I don’t want them to be upset if it sounds like I’m a playboy."</p><p>That monogamous person happens to be his longtime love and high school girlfriend <strong>Violetta Komyshan</strong>. <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong> broke the news</a> last month that Elgort and his sweetheart dancer were back together after breaking up last August.</p><p>"If you like someone and the sex is really good and you enjoy spending time together, why wouldn’t you make that person your girlfriend?" he mused to Elle. "Why go around dating random girls and having terrible sex when you can be with someone you really like?"</p><p>While Elgort did not confirm whether the person he lost his virginity to was Komyshan, the heartthrob alluded to her as he described his ideal significant other.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It's no one famous. To be honest, I don’t mind talking about my experiences in life, but details aren’t for everyone," he told Elle. "But if you can find a girl who you can go to an EDM concert with, have a conversation with, who will sit on the couch and watch you play GTA for three hours — and then you go to bed and have amazing sex? That should be your girlfriend."</p><p>Elgort, the son of fashion photographer <strong>Arthur Elgort </strong>and opera director <strong>Grethe Holby</strong>, noted that he's attracted to "strong" and "physical" women. "My dad photographed a lot of beautiful dancers. My mom was a dancer," he explained. "I love when a girl is like, 'I can’t hang out. I have to go to class.' And I go pick her up and she’s all sweaty in a leotard with her hair in a bun. That’s the hottest thing ever."</p><p>As for his own personal qualities? "I like romanticizing romance," he shared. "I’m a total goof. When I’m being really comfortable with my friends, I can be very goofy. I’m open with how I feel about someone."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJinq5Wheqa4xqiprWWcpMC1edWiqaChnp7BunnArWRqbF2drqV5zahknKSlmnq4tMCtZKJlp5bAbrDOoqWgZWJlfnZ9l2s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
