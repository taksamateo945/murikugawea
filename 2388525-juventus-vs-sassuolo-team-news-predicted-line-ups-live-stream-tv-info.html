Having enjoyed a mixed set of results in those previous outings, the Bianconeri will hope to make the match a routine win as they close in on a fourth consecutive domestic crown.</p><p>Beating <a href=#>Borussia Dortmund</a> in the Champions League and then holding Serie A title rivals <a href=#>AS Roma</a> to a draw clearly drained Massimiliano Allegri’s players. Their performance in Thursday’s Coppa Italia loss to <a href=#>Fiorentina</a> clearly reflected that as, despite heavy rotation, the Turin giants were nowhere near their effervescent best.</p><p>That result—and the reasons for it—were analysed in detail&nbsp;<a href=#>here</a>, and Juve will take comfort in knowing they have April’s second leg in which to turn the tie around. Now, however, they take on Eusebio Di Francesco’s Sassuolo, a team currently sitting in 12th place and possessing a trio of talented attacking players.</p><p>The Bianconeri are well aware of the need to continue winning despite their lead at the top of the table, a point made clear by Carlos Tevez when he spoke to Sky Italia this past weekend. Looking ahead to the meeting with the Neroverde, the Argentinian striker said (h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Football Italia</a>):</p><p>I don’t think this is a difficult time for us, we just need to step up the tempo a little and finish games off earlier. No matter what some people say, nine points isn’t enough of an advantage over Roma to relax.</p><p>We have to speed up and get the Scudetto under lock and key as soon as possible.</p><p>That approach is precisely what the home side will need on Monday night as they look to make amends for the draw they recorded the last time these two sides met.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/001/990/763/52920529b937faf321e72b94f841fb1e_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/001/990/763/52920529b937faf321e72b94f841fb1e_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Marco Vasini/Associated Press</span><p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, March 9</p><p><strong>Time:</strong>&nbsp;21:00.

Zaza, who goes<span>&nbsp;into the game having gone three matches without finding the back of the net,</span>&nbsp;added that he</span>&nbsp;"is not afraid of the challenge."</p><p><span>His side have suffered as a result, scoring just once as they lost to Fiorentina, Napoli and Sassuolo, losing the momentum gained from beating Inter at the beginning of February. With eight goals to his name, Zaza is&nbsp;Sassuolo’s leading scorer, and they will need him to return to form if they are to enjoy any success in this encounter.</span></p><p><strong>Key Battle</strong></p><p>While the scoring threat of Zaza should not be underestimated, the key matchup in this game could well come on the wing. Having joined a number of his team-mates in sitting out the Fiorentina loss, Patrice Evra is likely to return to the Juventus line-up and face a tough challenge in the form of Domenico Berardi.</p><img alt="TURIN, ITALY - DECEMBER 14: Patrice Evra of Juventus FC in action during the Serie A match between Juventus FC and UC Sampdoria at Juventus Arena on December 14, 2014 in Turin, Italy.

His deadly left foot is a dangerous weapon at set pieces, while his speed also frightens defences, and Mohamed Salah’s performance on Thursday highlighted the weakness Juventus have in that regard.</p><p>Evra is an experienced campaigner, however, and his ability to control Berardi could well decide the outcome of this clash.</p><p>Home win: 1/5</p><p>Away win: 12/1</p><p>Draw: 11/2</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaWxwaGp%2FdnnJrq2epqSqwG7C0maqmqujqrytu4ytnJqlXaOyuL%2BMqamenJmYwaawjKWgp51dqr20ecuirZ5lo6m%2Fpq3MZquvZZmjs7A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
