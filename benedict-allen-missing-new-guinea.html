Nor do I have an obvious means of returning to the outside world, which is somewhat worrying, especially at my advanced age.”</p><p>In his final tweet on Oct. 11, Allen posted a blurry picture of himself alongside the caption: “Marching off to Heathrow. I may be some time (don’t try to rescue me, please – where I’m going in PNG you won’t ever find me you know…)”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Marching off to Heathrow.

Goodness knows what has happened.”</p><p>“He might have been taken ill or is lying injured somewhere, perhaps with a broken leg, and maybe being helped by locals,” she continued.</p><p>Allen did not bring a phone or GPS with him into the jungle.</p><p>The 57-year-old began his exploring career while in college, when he took part in scientific expeditions to a volcano in Costa Rica and a remote forest in Brunei, and then led an expedition to a glacier in Iceland.</p><p>He is the only person known to have crossed the Amazon basin at its widest, and is the only person known to have crossed the Gobi Desert with camels alone.</p><p>Allen turned his experiences into popular books and presented numerous TV shows.</p><p>Over 30 years ago, when Allen was 24, he lived with and joined the isolated Niowra tribe in Papua New Guinea. Over the time he was there, Allen endured the brutal manhood initiation of the Niowra, where young men have their skin ritually scarred by being repeatedly cut with bamboo rods and being beaten every day for six months.</p><p>He was the first outsider to be accepted as one of the tribe.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-140576 alt="Paradise Allen" width=615 height=346 data-sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/paradise-allen.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-140576 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>BBC</span><span class=caption-body>Benedict Allen with the Niowra tribe of Papua New Guinea.</span></p><p>During his time with the Niowra, Allen briefly met the uncontacted Obini and Yaifo.</p><p>He had returned this year to make more sustained contact with the Yaifo tribe.</p><p>However, as of now, it is uncertain whether this encounter was a positive or negative one.</p><p>His sister explained, “For everybody else, it’s very exciting – all the expeditions and all the things he does, but for his sister and his wife, it’s more of a worry.”</p><p>Next, learn about the the <a href=#>uncontacted Awá</a>, the world’s most threatened tribe.
