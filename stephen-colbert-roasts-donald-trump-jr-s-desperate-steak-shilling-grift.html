After playing a clip of him promising meat delivered “to your door 100 percent of the time,” Colbert joked, “That sounds less like a delivery and more like a threat.”</p><p>But he was even more unnerved by a “steak-shilling video” that Trump Jr.’s <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle</a> made to “push his meat” in which she can be seen grilling them indoors.</p><p>“Holy carbon monoxide poisoning!” Colbert said in response. “Who grills like that inside the house?!” He imitated the former Fox News host becoming increasingly sleepy as she flipped steaks and <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>ranted about freedom</a>.</p><p>But there was one more question to be answered: “Given this family’s whole deal, what’s the grift here? Is it gopher meat? Maybe.”</p><p>Well, it turns out that Good Ranchers’ accreditation with the Better Business Bureau was <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>revoked</a> after numerous complaints, including one that claimed the steaks were “discolored and had sludge on them.”</p><p>“Well, like father, like steak,” Colbert joked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno6mysbTEp2Scp5yXsrPAjKummqukqHqlu82ao51lpKfCrryMo6lmq12ZsrS8xKuYrZ1dqMGmrcpmqqGhnKG2r7OMoKminqRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
