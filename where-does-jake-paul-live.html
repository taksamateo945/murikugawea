He founded the group, which called itself “Team 10.”</p><p>Although the home was in the beautiful and scenic area of Calabasas, the residence was not as serene as its surroundings. Team 10’s antics at their place often garnered media attention for their controversial actions.</p><p>Most notably, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) executed a search warrant on the property related to “investigations of criminal acts” allegedly committed by the YouTube personality.

Many members opened up about their decisions to leave the house.&nbsp;</p><p>Musical duo and brothers Ivan and Emilio Martinez left the Team 10 house in 2017, creating a <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube video</a> to explain their choice.&nbsp;</p><p>In the video, Emilio Martinez says, “I want you to imagine that you go to somewhere that no one talks Spanish or your language and you see people in the house laughing, and you don’t even know what they’re talking about, and then you find out that they were talking s**t about you. They were laughing at you. Every single day.”</p><p>In the video, Ivan and Emilio Martinez say that they were the targets of intense bullying while they lived with Jake Paul, including Jake Paul calling them racial slurs and pressured them into appearing in videos that they found offensive.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Seventeen Magazine</a> also reported that previous Team 10 member Alissa Violet was actually kicked out of the residence in 2017. What followed was a huge social media blowup between Violet and Paul.&nbsp;</p><p>Jake Paul claimed that he kicked Alissa Violet out of the residence for cheating on him, but she claimed in a <a href=# rel=noopener>response video</a> that the two were never actually dating; although they had previously sold merch with their “ship name” on it, Violet said that the pair were not a couple nor had they confirmed their relationship in real life.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the issues between those actually living at Jake Paul’s home in Calabasas, there with issues with their neighbors that began to escalate.&nbsp;</p><p>Neighbors complained about the loud stunts that Jake Paul and the Team 10 members would pull, including one notorious incident where Jake Paul set furniture on fire in an empty swimming pool.
