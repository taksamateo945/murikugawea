Lady Gaga shared a video of herself modeling one of the six HAUS collections that will be available in the line. The video has gone viral as fans are getting a better look at what the makeup line will entail. Lady Gaga wanted to create a line that could easily go from day to the club to after-the-show parties and she succeeded. Entering the beauty business seems like a no-brainer and some may ask what took Lady Gaga so long. Now some are questioning how much of a game changer Lady Gaga’s HAUS collection will be for other beauty moguls such as Rihanna, Kylie Jenner, and Kim Kardashian-West.</p><p>Celebrity makeup artist Sarah Nicole Tanno did Lady Gaga’s makeup for the video shoot and shared several hints regarding how she got the incredible look. Sarah Tanno has asked everyone who buys the makeup to not only hashtag Lady Gaga when they share photos of themselves wearing the products, but also her and #HAUSLabs.</p><p>You may see the video Sarah shared featuring Lady Gaga below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0vp0VhtDv/</p><p>Frederic Aspiras is Lady Gaga’s hairstylist and styled everyone’s hair for the HAUS Labs photo shoot. Lady Gaga’s hair looked gorgeous in platinum blonde and flowing down past her shoulders. Her hair was thick, wavy, and had a glamorous, rock-star feel which was a perfect complement to her striking Metal-Head makeup.</p><p>He also shared a behind-the-scenes video from HAUS Laboratories showing Lady Gaga welcoming the models before the start of their photo shoot.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzwmTKRHpY1/</p><p>Lady Gaga named all of the products in her makeup collection and in the photo above she is wearing the lip gloss BLAZE with the lip liner RIDE. The deep color around her eyes is ATTACK and the HAUS collection is made to be worn thin or heavy, depending upon how you apply it. Each HAUS will consist of a lip liner, lip color, and color glimmer, shimmer. HAUS Laboratories describe the HAUS collections as containing the following.</p><p>“GLAM ATTACK: All-over liquid shimmer powder. A highly pigmented, long-wearing all-over color amplifier.&nbsp;&nbsp;RIP LIP LINER: A lip liner to die for. A creamy, demi-matte, highly pigmented lip pencil. And LE RIOT LIP GLOSS: An ultra high-shine multidimensional lip gloss.”</p><p>There are six HAUSES and each contains the GLAM ATTACK, RIP LIP LINER, and the LE RIOT LIP GLOSS in different colors. The six HAUSES are as follows: HAUS of Goddess, HAUS of Metal Head, HAUS of Rose B*tch, HAUS of Rockstar, HAUS of Chained Ballerina and Haus of Dynasty.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think of Lady Gaga’s new HAUS Laboratories makeup collection?
