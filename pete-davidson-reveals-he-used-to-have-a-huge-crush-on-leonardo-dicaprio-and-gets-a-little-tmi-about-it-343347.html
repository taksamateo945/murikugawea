According to the SNL funny man, he used to have a massive crush on none other than Leonardo DiCaprio! Well, isn’t that everybody?</p><p>The comedian didn’t shy away from giving some spicy details, such as the fact that he’d get turned on by Leo’s ‘acting!’</p><p>The last part sounded more like him trying to save himself so he did not clarify what he actually meant!</p><p>Either way, while Pete has been associated romantically to an array of beautiful and famous women of various ages, it turns out that in his teen years, it was a man who owned his heart.</p><p>During an interview for PAPER Magazine, Pete got really candid, sharing that he had the biggest celeb crush on the famous actor.</p><p>He then went on to clarify that ‘Well, I used to j*rk off to Leonardo DiCaprio… Uhh, like his acting. Yeah. I used to have a HUGE crush on Leonardo DiCaprio. I had this huge poster of him from The Beach in my room, and there used to be, like, ‘Leo love books’… Do you remember? Like, right when Titanic came out [when I was] in like the third or fourth grade, he was just like, ‘teen milk.’ There were love books and I had all of them. He was the coolest.’</p><p>While his story seems all too familiar to many people around his age, Pete was lucky enough to actually meet Leo, unlike many others who also crushed on him in their teen years.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Apparently, the experience was nearly too much for Pete to handle: ‘I’ve met him twice and I’ve just shaken hands and run away fast, like — Yeah, it’s too much.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegmsGmecOaraKco6S7br7Er5yapKNitaZ51KycnWWkpHqprdWeZJplmKq0pnnCq6ysoF2ku264xKilmqqUpHqltcKap6uhn2Kur7CMoJytq12Weq21062jnmWkorZurcGorK1lmal6dICSbGtwZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
