Failing and unmaintained septic systems and cesspools have created an excess amount of nitrogen pollution in the region’s water supply, becoming a serious threat to Long Island’s water quality, wildlife, quality of life; and has already decimated the once iconic shellfish industry. Nitrogen poisoning has additionally destroyed the region’s coastal vegetation, which acts as a natural habitat for marine and aviary life as well as a natural buffer against devastating storm surges as seen during Superstorm Sandy. The County has identified 360,000 unsewered homes that contribute to nearly 70% of the nitrogen pollution load, and has developed an actionable, long term plan to sewer targeted areas, fortify existing waste water infrastructure, and bring advanced on-site waste water treatment systems to residential properties that are contributing most to the nitrification of waters. To date, Bellone has worked extensively with state and federal officials to secure a historic investment of more than $380 million and is seeking further funding to help reduce excess nitrogen pollution, invest in wastewater infrastructure and help to protect coastal vegetation and marshlands.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Steve Bellone height</b> Not available right now.

The Suffolk County deficit currently stands at $89.9 million, a reduction of $411 million in two years.</p><p align=justify>Since Bellone took office, the administration has enacted a series of government reforms and offered a variety of proposals to improve government efficiencies while maintaining reduced staffing levels.
