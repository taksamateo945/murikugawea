My father was an entrepreneur. He owns his own chemical company. My mother is also an entrepreneur, owning numerous childcare centers throughout Atlanta. I started out working in the family business, which was childcare. I ended up starting my own childcare center [at] 24 years old. Being an entrepreneur gives me the power to come up with a product that is close to my heart, and [a chance to] offer something to inspire other women and help them express themselves.‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs86P4Wg3nm/</p><p>The TV personality added: ‚ÄúMommy entrepreneurs must be sure to have a great support system. And you have to make sure that the type of business that you want to start will be good for you and your family. I wouldn‚Äôt get into just anything. If you don‚Äôt have someone to keep your kids and the best support, you may want to start a business that‚Äôs online, where you could be working from home. Start a business that‚Äôll be practical for your real lifestyle. Research it and just go for it. Dream big and put in the hard work. Always use your kids as the focus and the purpose and the drive for what you‚Äôre going to do.‚Äù</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Porsha is doing this pregnancy thing very well.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegpL%2B0tMBmrqKknJ6urr%2BMsJinrJWZerW7jK2YpJ1dqLyusYysq66mnp67qHnPopqtraKawG60xKtkm5mSrnq0wM6lnGasmJp6tLzOraOin5ipeqPFjKamr6GenHqivs6upZ1lop28onnFmqWsZZOWu6%2B702aZnqSZmsOmedOhnKKqXZrGpr%2BMa2tsa2RtfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
