Smith and Michael Wilbon, as Smith revealed on Monday's <i>First Take </i>(5:00 mark). "No question about it."</p><p>There's no question that Edwards is one of the ascendant young stars in the game. He's already been a two-time All-Star at the age of 22 and is fresh off setting career highs in points (25.9 PPG), assists (5.1 APG) and field-goal percentage (46.1 percent) this season, all while appearing in 79 total games.</p><p>That helped to pace a 56-26 season for the Timberwolves, good for the No. 3 seed in this year's playoffs and a first-round matchup with the Suns.</p><p>His respect around the NBA is growing. In a player poll run by The Athletic's <u><a href=# rel=noopener>Sam Amick and Josh Robbin</a></u>s, 10.3 percent of 136 voters said they would pick Edwards first if they were building a franchise from scratch. Only 20-year-old rookie phenom Victor Wembanyama (27.9 percent) and two-time league MVP Nikola JokiÄ‡ (27.2 percent) received more votes.</p><p>He probably earned some respect from one of his NBA heroes, Kevin Durant, during Game 1 as well after an exchange that went viral.
